# HW 2 Support Vector Machines
## Contents

#### 1. Implemented Kernel SVM using Quadratic Programming. Tested on the human action recognition dataset. Implementation can be found in the question3.m MATLAB script.
#### 2. Implemented Multiclass SVM using Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer from scratch. Tested the implementation on the UCF 101 Action recognition dataset. Code can be found in the question3.m MATLAB script.
#### 3. Tested out the SVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer for Human Face Detection. Used the Big Bang Theory Images dataset and used HOG features. The implementation can be found in the question4.m MATLAB script.
